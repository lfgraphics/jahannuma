# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical build-time URL parsing errors that prevent proper server-side rendering (SSR) and SEO optimization in the Next.js application. The current implementation fails to construct valid URLs during build time when fetching data from Airtable APIs, resulting in "Failed to parse URL" errors. This feature will implement a robust server-side data fetching solution that ensures SEO-ready pages while maintaining reliable API communication with Airtable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want pages to load with complete content during server-side rendering, so that search engines can properly index the content and I get fast initial page loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch all required data during server-side rendering without URL parsing errors
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL successfully generate static pages with pre-fetched data
3. WHEN search engine crawlers visit pages THEN the system SHALL serve fully rendered HTML with complete content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable API URL construction for both client and server environments, so that data fetching works consistently across all rendering contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made from server components THEN the system SHALL construct absolute URLs using proper base URL configuration
2. WHEN API calls are made from client components THEN the system SHALL use relative URLs that work in browser context
3. WHEN the application runs in different environments (development, production, build) THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and use the correct base URL
4. IF base URL is not configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with configuration guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want Airtable data to be available immediately when pages load, so that users see complete content without loading states for critical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages are server-side rendered THEN the system SHALL pre-fetch Airtable data and include it in the initial HTML
2. WHEN Airtable API calls fail during SSR THEN the system SHALL implement graceful fallbacks without breaking the build
3. WHEN data is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL cache it appropriately to improve performance
4. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without causing build failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between server-side and client-side data fetching logic, so that the codebase is maintainable and debugging is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing data fetching THEN the system SHALL provide separate utilities for server and client contexts
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide context-specific error messages indicating whether the issue is server-side or client-side
3. WHEN debugging data fetching issues THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive logging for both environments
4. WHEN new API endpoints are added THEN the system SHALL follow consistent patterns for URL construction and error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the build process to complete successfully even when external APIs are temporarily unavailable, so that deployments are not blocked by third-party service issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Airtable API is unavailable during build THEN the system SHALL use cached data or graceful fallbacks
2. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL handle errors without breaking the build process
3. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff before falling back
4. WHEN build completes with API issues THEN the system SHALL log warnings but not fail the deployment
